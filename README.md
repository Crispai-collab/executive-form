# executive-form
Executive Self-Assessment Form is a simple, clean, and fully static HTML form designed for executive self-evaluation. It is ideal for embedding into existing websites or using as a standalone tool. This project is built with pure HTML and minimal CSS, making it lightweight and fast-loading. The form features a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. You can easily customize the form questions and layout by editing the HTML file.

To get started, clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:Crispai-collab/executive-form.git`, then navigate to the project directory with `cd executive-form`. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to preview the form. No additional setup is required since this is a static project. For a better development experience, you may use a local server like `live-server`.

You can customize the form questions by editing the `index.html` file, and style the form by modifying the CSS in the `assets/styles.css` file. If you want to integrate this form into an existing website, simply copy the HTML and CSS.

The project structure is straightforward, consisting of the main `index.html` and a folder named `assets` that contains the CSS styles. Contributions to improve or extend the form are welcome via GitHub pull requests.
